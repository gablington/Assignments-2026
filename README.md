## Assignment 1: The Bohr atom
This code is designed to take user inputs for atomic numbe (Z), initial energy level ($n_{initial}$), and final energy level ($n_{final}$) in the de-excitation of a Bohr atom to find the energy of the photon released in the transition. Photon energy can be calculated using  <br>
$$E = 13.6(\frac{1}{n_{final}^2}- \frac{1}{n_{initial}^2})Z^2$$ eV. <br>
This is also converted to frequency and wavelength using $E=hf$ and $c=f\lambda$. The user is then asked if they wish to repeat the programme. Energy can be expressed in units of eV and Joules.

By interpreting user inputs as one stream and converting to string stream, the first three inputs can be individually valiadted. New inputs are scrutinised repeatedly until a valid input is given.

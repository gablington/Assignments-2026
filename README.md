## Assignment 1: The Bohr atom
This code is designed to take user inputs for atomic number, initial energy level, and final energy level in the de-excitation of a Bohr atom to find the energy of the photon released in the transition. Photon energy can be calculated using 
$$E = 13.6*(\frac{1}{n_{final}^2}- \frac{1}{n_{initial}^2}) eV.$$
This is also converted to frequency and wavelength using $E=hf$ and $c=f*\lambda$. The user is then asked if they wish to repeat the process. Energy can be expressed in units of eV and Joules.
